### Procedure

### Simulator 1 :-
1. Enter the input values of I<sub>0</sub>, I<sub>1</sub> and Select line(S).The inputs should be either 0 or 1.

2. We can choose the position of the fault. A,B,C,D,E,F,G,H are the eight positions where the fault can occur.

3. Select 'check' to run the simulation. The table gives the expected and final output. If a fault is detected, it will be highlighted in red.

4. If we want to enable faults in multiple places, input 1 should be given in those places.

5. Select 'check' to run the simulation. The table gives the expected and final output. If a fault is detected, it will be highlighted in red.

6. For further tests, repeat the above steps.

7. 'Reset' button resets the entire table. The simulation gives the expected and final output for the input combination entered by the user.


### Simulator 2 :-
1. Enter the value of expected output Y.

2. Enter the value of final output Y'.

3. Select 'check' to run the simulation.

The simulation gives the expected presence of SA1 fault at various input/output signal lines. If the final output is different from the expected output, it displays the possible faults.
